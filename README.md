Final design
#An animation that simulates fireworks, with vertical lines rising up to become shapes at random locations, and when the lines turn into shapes, a sound from music scale will be played. The randomly played sounds will make up a unique piece of music. There is a slider in the upper right corner to adjust the number of fireworks, and press key "s" to stop or play the sound.

Prototype-1

A model of a falling raindrop was designed as the basis for the entire project.

Prototype-2

Changed the fall to a rise and combined it with the pattern from group work.

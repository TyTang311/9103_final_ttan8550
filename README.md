Final design  
An animation that simulates fireworks, with vertical lines rising up to become patterns at random locations, and when the lines turn into patterns, a sound from music scale will be played. The randomly played sounds will make up a unique piece of music. There is a slider in the upper right corner to adjust the number of fireworks, and press key "s" to stop or play the sound.

Prototype-1  
A model of a falling raindrop was designed as the basis for the entire project.

Prototype-2  
Changed the fall to a rise and combined it with the pattern from group work.

Prototype-3  
Add sounds so that each pattern plays a sound when it is generated. Each sound lasts about 4 seconds, and a sound can only be called again if it finishes playing. There are cases where a pattern is generated but no sound is played, because it calls a sound that didn't finish playing.

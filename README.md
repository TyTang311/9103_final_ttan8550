An animation that simulates fireworks, with vertical lines rising up to become shapes at random locations, and when the lines turn into shapes, a sound from music scale will be played. The randomly played sounds will make up a unique piece of music. There is a slider in the upper right corner to adjust the number of fireworks, and press key "s" to stop or play the sound.
